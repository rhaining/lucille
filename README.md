## Lucille

A Giphy Hipchat bot.

Once running, any time someone types "/giphy " then a search term into Hipchat, Lucille will return a random gif matching that term.

## Note

I'm not currently working on this project. I'm happy to review/accept pull requests though.


## Get Started

- Rename lucille_sample.cfg to lucille.cfg & enter in your Hipchat room name.
- Rename hipchat_sample.cfg to hipchat.cfg & enter in your Hipchat API token.
